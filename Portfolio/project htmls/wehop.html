It incorporates both <span>physical and cerebral</span> activity to <span>inspire movement in children</span> and beautifully balances exercise and fun by raising the pulse while having to solve challenging tasks. It has a wide catalogue with both single and multiplayer games, making it a <span>social activity.</span></p>

I helped with designing every aspect of the physical interaction between the user and the product, developed the games, and had full responsibility of designing the UX and the UI of the game display. </p>

                    <p>According to Generation Pep, only two out of ten children reach the recommendations of at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day. Children from families with lower socioeconomic status may be at a high risk of being affected by this, as 51% of children from low income families engage in organized physical activity as opposed to 82% of children from high income families. The challenge for this project was to develop a solution that can change this alarming trend, while making it accessible to a large population of children.</p>

                                We created weHop, a <span>game platform based on interactive tiles</span> that react to interaction through pressure sensors and give visual and auditory feedback upon interaction. The platform is controlled through a touch display which offers a game catalogue with a <span>wide range of games</span>, both single-player and multiplayer based. The games incorporate both <span>physical</span> (jumping at the tiles) <span>as well as cerebral activity</span> (solving challenging tasks from the games). The <span>grid is flexible</span>, as the tiles can be rearranged into any desired pattern. The <span>central focus of wehHop is fun</span>: the <span>physical engagement is a bonus</span>. To make weHop accessible, we suggest it to be <span>sold to schools</span> beyond being sold for private use.

                                        To play weHop, the user interacts with a display where they can browse through the game catalogue and read instructions about the games and choose difficulty level. The games we developed were for instance:
                                    </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> <span> Maths (single-player): </span>jump to the tile which is less than or greater than a number being shouted out through a speaker</li>
                                            <li><span> Memory (single-player): </span>memorize the pattern that the grid displays and jump on the right tiles</li>
                                            <li><span> HopAttack (single-player): </span>similar to Whack-A-Mole; jump to the tile that lights up as fast as possible </li>
                                            <li><span> Squid Games (multiplayer): </span>mulitplayer version of the singleplayer Memory game</li> 
                                        </ul>

                                    <p>
                                        When the user has chosen to play a game, they can start interact with the tiles. Although the default shape of the grid is a hexagon, the tiles are flexible and can be rearranged in any pattern or shape. The tiles react to jumps through pressure sensors, give tactile, visual and auditory feedback through the bouncy material, led lights and speakers. When the game is finished, the progress and high scores can be seen on the display. The fanastic thing about weHop is that it is a game platform, making it highly flexible and expandable as any new games could be programmed into the software.

                        As weHop is aimed towards young children, we wanted the design to deliver playful, friendly, positive and empathetic emotions. I searched for thick and round fonts with a playful style, and a colorful color palette with strong and popful yet dark and deep colors. It was important to make the style gender neutral and somewhat age neutral, even if the product is aimed towards children, as we wanted to make it accessible to as many users as possible.

                        The prototypes include wireframes of the start screen, choice of game mode, game catalogue and game instructions of a selected range of games. Wireframes that were considered but not prototyped were sign up and sign in screens, instructions of all the developed games, and highscore screens.
